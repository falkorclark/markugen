Thanks to [Trevor Buckner](https://github.com/calculuschild) for mastering Marked!

Thanks to [Christopher Jeffrey](https://github.com/chjj) for starting Marked!

Much of this development and inspiration came from the [Unified](https://unifiedjs.com/)
collective and all of the plugins developed for [remark](https://github.com/remarkjs/remark)
and [rehype](https://github.com/rehypejs/rehype). These modules were used first,
but due to limitations with packagers like [pkg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pkg)
and [nexe](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nexe) and not supporting ESM modules, I 
chose to switch to [marked](https://marked.js.org/) for the CommonJS support.
