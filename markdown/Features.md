# Features
Markugen has a decent set of features and components that come built-in. This
section of the documentation will walk you through all features from
Markugen [options](./Features/Options.md) to [styles](./Features/Styles.md) 
and [components](./Features/Components.md).

## Feature Requests
Markugen is a work in-progress and will continue to be enhanced as long as it is
being used (I use it for my development, so it will be improved regularly).

Please feel free to submit your feature requests on GitHub at
[github.com/falkorclark/markugen](https://github.com/falkorclark/markugen/issues)
and I will be happy to add them as I have time.
