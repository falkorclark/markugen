# Text File Test
This page is a test of markdown that uses a text file instead of a markdown
file extension.

## Link Test
This test is for links to markdown files that get converted by Markugen.

This is a link that has the URL in the text as well:
[Layout.md](./Layout.md#another-section).

## Double Colon Test
Double colons cause line breaks, this is a test of double colon results:

`Is there a line break here Foo::Bar`

What about in normal text? Foo\:\:Bar

What about a code block?

```cpp
#include "Bar.h"

class Foo {}

void foo()
{
  Foo::bar();
}
```
