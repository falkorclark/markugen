# Layout Test
This page has a lot of sections to test the layout of the Table of Contents
and how the links react when clicked.

## Dynamic Variables Test
This tests the use of dynamic variables in template expansion:

{{
  let out = '';
  for (const [key, value] of Object.entries(vars.links))
    out += `[${key}](${value})\n\n`;
  return out;
}}
