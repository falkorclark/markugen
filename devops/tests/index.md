# Markugen
Markugen was designed to make it easier for developers and non-developers to
create an entire website from a set of Markdown files. It is designed with 
brevity, clarity, and ease-of-use in mind. Additionally, the pages produced 
are static pages allowing for viewing without the need for a server.

Markugen was designed to help with documentation of programs developed at
Anyar, Inc. The documentation you are viewing right now was generated using
Markugen.
